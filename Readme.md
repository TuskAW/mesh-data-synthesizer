# Mesh Data Synthesizer: Data Generation and Visual Place Recognition using Unreal Engine and Cesium

> [!WARNING]  
> **üèóÔ∏è This README is still under construction.** More Information will be added in the future. In the meantime, if you have any questions feel free to open an issue.
Currently, it focuses on the data generation features of the tool. The code for the live inference and search features are already available, but they are not yet documented.

Photorealistic 3D meshes open up new possibilities for generating and leveraging data for various applications, including data generation for large-scale geospatial analysis. This project, titled "Someplace," focuses on the creation of high-quality, synthetic datasets using 3D models, which can be applied to a range of tasks such as visual place recognition.

## Future Work

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> I currently have very limited time and resources to work on this project. I have no idea when or if these features will be completed.

- Improve documentation
- Properly separate Mesh Data Synth from Mesh based VPR
  - Currently, both are tightly coupled, since VPR was the main use case for this project
- Improve Stability
  - Currently, mostly the happy path is supported a lot of errors will lead to crashes or give no feedback
- Support Generation of data other than RGB images (for example, depth)
- Make it easier to implement custom data generators
  - E.g. drone/birds-eye perspectives

## Project Structure

The project consists of two parts, first a data generation tool using Unreal Engine and Cesium, and second code for utilizing the generated data for visual place recognition.

- `MeshSynth` contains the Unreal Engine project and relevant assets.
  - This code is used to generate images for a certain area
  - It also contains a UI which allows the user to query the geolocation of an image
- `VprServer` contains the server code which can be used to manage a database of features and query the geolocation of an image
  - You can completely ignore this folder if you are only interested in generating images

## Data Generation

### Available 3D Models

The Tool requires 3D models to be in the [3D Tiles format](https://github.com/CesiumGS/3d-tiles).
Cesium 3D Tiles are an open specification for streaming massive heterogeneous 3D geospatial datasets.
They are visualizes in the Unreal Engine using the [Cesium for Unreal plugin](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-unreal).
The easiest way to access model data source for large scale 3D models is [Cesium Ion](https://cesium.com/ion/).

The packaged version of this tool requires you to enter a [Cesium Ion Access Token](https://cesium.com/learn/ion/cesium-ion-access-tokens/) in the UI.

<img src="./Docs/Assets/main-menu-screenshot.png" alt="Token Input" width="640px">

The default model used here is the [Photorealistic 3D Tiles](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/tile/3d-tiles) by Google.
If you want to use another model from Cesium you will have to open the project in Unreal Engine and modify/add a level.
Some example levels with different models can be found in the `Content/ECCV_2024` folder.
You are also able to stream models from a host other than Cesium Ion see [Loading datasets from other sources](https://cesium.com/learn/unreal/unreal-datasets/#loading-datasets-from-other-sources).

You can find a selection of available models from Cesium Ion and other sources in the table below.

### Generating a new dataset

Click the **+** button on the left to open the dataset generation menu.

<img src="./Docs/Assets/sample-new-dataset-screenshot.png" alt="Dataset Generation Menu" width="640px">

Enter your parameters. The most important one is the selection of the sampling area.
To mark an area, click on the "New" Button next Sampling Area Label.
Afterwards repeatedly click on the map to add new points to your polygon.
If you are unhappy with your selection, you can start again by clicking "New" again.

<img src="./Docs/Assets/create-polygon-screenshot.png" alt="Sampling Area Selection" width="640px">

After you are happy with your parameters hit the "Start Sampling" button.
This will start the generation of the dataset.

1. OpenStreetMap will be queried to get the streets in the area.
2. The streets will be used to build a path that the camera will follow.
3. The camera will take images along the path.

The images will be saved in the `MeshSynth/Saved/` folder. Metadata will be encoded in the filename following the format:

```
@UTM_east@UTM_north@UTM_zone_number@UTM_zone_letter@latitude@longitude@pano_id@tile_num@heading@pitch@roll@altitude@timestamp@note@extension
```

<img src="./Docs/Assets/sample-progress-screenshot.png" alt="Dataset Generation Progress" width="640px">

### Custom dataset generation

The code of this repo contains other sampling utilities, that can be used to generate datasets that are not bound to streets.
As a starter you can look at extending the `MTSamplerComponentBase`, you can also look at the implementations `MTWayGraphSamplerComponent` (Street/OSM based), `MTReSamplerComponent` (CSV based) and `MTExtraViewSamplerComponent` (Generate additional samples for an existing dataset).

More detailed instructions might follow in the future.

## Inference

> [!WARNING]  
> üèóÔ∏è Docs under construction

The relevant code is inside the Server Directory.
This code is used to manage a live database of features and query the geolocation of an image.
However, you can also modify parts of the code to cater evaluation needs e.g. by loading it 
into FAISS instead of a live vector DB.
You can also find a function that splits the panoramas into slices in the `app.py`.

The model currently hardcoded into the inference server is SALAD + SALAD-MeshVPR.
SALAD is automatically fetched from torchhub to get SALAD-MeshVPR head over to https://github.com/gmberton/MeshVPR

## Searching (Geo Location Queries)

> [!WARNING]  
> üèóÔ∏è Docs under construction

This requires you to have the Server running in the background and a dataset loaded into the vector DB (Redis).
The server address must be set in the bottom right of the client UI (see images above).
If a server is connected you will be able to query the geolocation of an image by using the right side of the interface.

Make sure you uncheck the "Offline Mode" checkbox to enable the search functionality.

## MeshVPR

The underlying machine learning model to achieve the geolocation task is MeshVPR, a visual place recognition model that uses 3D meshes to match images across different locations. You can find the code for the model here https://github.com/gmberton/MeshVPR
